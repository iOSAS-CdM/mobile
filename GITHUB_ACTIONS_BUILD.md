# GitHub Actions Build Guide for iOSAS

This project is configured to automatically build Android APK and AAB files using **GitHub Actions** whenever you push to the `release` branch. The build happens entirely within GitHub's infrastructure - no external build service required.

## Overview

- **Build Trigger**: Automatically on push to `release` branch
- **Build Location**: GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- **Build Time**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Outputs**: APK (for testing) + AAB (for Play Store)
- **Auto Release**: Creates a GitHub Release with downloadable APK/AAB
- **Cost**: Free (uses GitHub Actions minutes)

## How It Works

### The Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yaml`)

1. **Triggers** on push to `release` branch or manual dispatch
2. **Sets up environment**:
   - Node.js 18 with Yarn
   - Java JDK 17 for Android builds
   - Gradle caching for faster builds
3. **Installs dependencies** using `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
4. **Runs Expo Prebuild** to generate native Android project
5. **Builds**:
   - APK (release) - for direct installation on devices
   - AAB (release bundle) - for Google Play Store uploads
6. **Uploads artifacts** to GitHub (available for 30 days)
7. **Creates a GitHub Release** with:
   - Version tag from `package.json` (e.g., `v1.0.0-123`)
   - Release notes with commit information
   - APK and AAB files attached as downloadable assets
   - Automatic installation instructions

### No Secrets Required (for basic builds)

The workflow uses the debug keystore by default, so you can start building immediately without any configuration. For production releases, you can optionally configure a proper release keystore (see below).

## Usage

### Quick Release (Recommended)

Use the built-in release command to trigger a build with one command:

```bash
# Make your changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"

# Trigger release build
yarn release
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check for uncommitted changes
2. ‚úÖ Push your current branch
3. ‚úÖ Switch to release branch
4. ‚úÖ Merge master into release
5. ‚úÖ Push release to trigger build
6. ‚úÖ Switch back to your original branch
7. ‚úÖ Show build monitoring links

### Manual Release (Alternative)

Or trigger manually with Git commands:

```bash
# 1. Develop on Master Branch
git checkout master
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push origin master

# 2. Trigger Build by Pushing to Release
git checkout release
git merge master
git push origin release
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically start building.

### Monitor Build Progress

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/iOSAS-CdM/mobile
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Click on the running workflow
4. Watch real-time logs as it builds

Or if you used `yarn release`, the script will show you the direct links!

### Download Your Build

After the build completes successfully, you have **two ways** to download:

#### Option A: From GitHub Releases (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/iOSAS-CdM/mobile
2. Click the **Releases** section (right sidebar)
3. Click on the latest release (e.g., `v1.0.0-123`)
4. Scroll down to **Assets**
5. Download:
   - `app-release.apk` - For testing on devices
   - `app-release.aab` - For uploading to Google Play Store

**Releases are permanent** - they don't expire like artifacts!

#### Option B: From Actions Artifacts (30-day limit)

1. Go to the **Actions** tab
2. Click on the completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section
4. Download:
   - **android-apk** - For testing on devices
   - **android-aab** - For uploading to Google Play Store
5. Note: Artifacts expire after 30 days

### Install and Test

**For APK (Testing)**:
- Transfer the APK to your Android device
- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in device settings
- Open and install the APK
- Test your app!

**For AAB (Play Store)**:
- Go to Google Play Console
- Upload the AAB to a release track
- Follow Google's release process

## Available Commands

- **`yarn release`** - Trigger a release build (automatic merge and push)
- **`yarn start`** - Start Metro bundler for development
- **`yarn android`** - Run on Android device/emulator
- **`yarn ios`** - Run on iOS device/simulator
- **`yarn web`** - Run in web browser
- **`yarn version:bump`** - Manually bump version (usually automatic)

## Version Management

The workflow automatically creates releases using the version from `package.json` combined with the build number.

### Release Tag Format

- **Tag**: `v{version}-{build_number}`
  - Example: `v1.0.0-123` (version 1.0.0, build 123)
- **Name**: `Release v{version} (Build {build_number})`
  - Example: `Release v1.0.0 (Build 123)`

### Updating Version

To release a new version, update the version in `package.json`:

```bash
# Edit package.json and change "version": "1.0.0" to "1.0.1"
git checkout master
# Update version manually or use npm
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
# or
npm version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
# or
npm version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

git push origin master

# Merge to release to build
git checkout release
git merge master
git push origin release
```

### Release Notes

Each release automatically includes:
- **Version and build number**
- **Build date and time**
- **Latest commit message and author**
- **Download links** for APK and AAB
- **Installation instructions**

You can customize release notes by editing the `.github/workflows/build.yaml` file.

### Finding Your Releases

All releases are available at:
- Direct link: https://github.com/iOSAS-CdM/mobile/releases
- Or click **Releases** in the right sidebar of your repository

## Configuring Release Keystore (Recommended for Production)

For production releases to Google Play, you should sign with a proper release keystore.

### Step 1: Generate a Keystore (One Time)

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-release-key.keystore \
  -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=iOSAS, OU=Mobile, O=iOSAS-CdM, L=City, ST=State, C=US"
```

**Save this keystore file securely!** You'll need it for all future releases.

### Step 2: Encode Keystore as Base64

```bash
base64 -i my-release-key.keystore -o keystore-base64.txt
# On macOS: base64 -i my-release-key.keystore -o keystore-base64.txt
# On Linux: base64 -w 0 my-release-key.keystore > keystore-base64.txt
```

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/iOSAS-CdM/mobile/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add these four secrets:

| Secret Name         | Value                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64`   | Contents of `keystore-base64.txt`       |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Password you set when creating keystore |
| `KEY_ALIAS`         | `my-key-alias` (or whatever you used)   |
| `KEY_PASSWORD`      | Key password you set                    |

### Step 4: Update Workflow to Use Release Keystore

Add this step to `.github/workflows/build.yaml` before the build steps:

```yaml
      - name: üîë Decode and Setup Release Keystore
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/release'
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}" | base64 -d > android/app/my-release-key.keystore
          echo "MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=${{ secrets.KEY_ALIAS }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.KEY_PASSWORD }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

The Gradle build will automatically pick up these environment variables (they're already configured in `android/app/build.gradle`).

## Workflow Customization

### Build on Different Branches

Edit `.github/workflows/build.yaml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release
      - main  # Add more branches
```

### Build Only APK or Only AAB

Remove the step you don't need from the workflow file.

### Add Automated Testing

Add this step before building:

```yaml
      - name: üß™ Run Tests
        run: yarn test
```

### Build for Multiple Architectures

Edit the Gradle command:

```yaml
      - name: üèóÔ∏è Build Android APK (Release)
        run: |
          cd android
          ./gradlew assembleRelease -PreactNativeArchitectures=armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Gradle Daemon"

The workflow uses `--no-daemon` to prevent daemon issues. If you still see problems, check the full logs in the Actions tab.

### Build Fails with "Out of Memory"

Add this to `android/gradle.properties`:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m
```

### Dependencies Not Installing

The workflow uses `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`. Make sure your `yarn.lock` is committed and up to date:

```bash
yarn install
git add yarn.lock
git commit -m "chore: Update yarn.lock"
```

### APK Won't Install on Device

- Make sure you enabled "Install from Unknown Sources"
- Check that the APK is for the correct architecture (arm64-v8a for modern devices)
- Try uninstalling any existing version first

## Advantages vs EAS Build

| Feature              | GitHub Actions             | EAS Build                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**             | Free (public repos)        | Requires subscription for frequent builds |
| **Build Time**       | 5-10 minutes               | 10-20 minutes (queue + build)             |
| **Transparency**     | Full logs in GitHub        | Logs in EAS dashboard                     |
| **Customization**    | Full control over workflow | Limited to EAS options                    |
| **Artifact Storage** | 30 days in GitHub          | Download from EAS dashboard               |
| **Setup**            | Configure workflow once    | Requires EXPO_TOKEN and credentials       |

## Optional: Using EAS for Updates Only

You can still use EAS for **over-the-air updates** without using it for builds:

```bash
# Publish an update
eas update --branch production --message "Bug fixes"
```

Your GitHub Actions-built APK/AAB can still receive OTA updates from EAS Update service.

## Summary

‚úÖ Push to `release` branch ‚Üí Automatic build in GitHub Actions
‚úÖ Download APK/AAB from Actions artifacts
‚úÖ No external build service required
‚úÖ Free and fast
‚úÖ Full control over the build process

For questions or issues, check the Actions logs or open an issue in the repository.
